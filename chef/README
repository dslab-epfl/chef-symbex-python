Setting up the Chef environment for Python
------------------------------------------

The guest setup for running Python programs with Chef is mostly
automated by the chef/Makefile.interp file, which prepares a Python
virtualenv configured with instrumented Python interpreters at various
symbolic optimization levels.

We assume the following project structure in the guest:

$CHEF_ROOT
  - python-src (the Python code base -- this tree)
    - chef
      - build (does not exist, you need to create it).


Phase 1: Preparing the guest environment. This phase should run in
normal (KVM) mode in S2E. Consult the main Chef README file for more
details.


In the $CHEF_ROOT/python-src/chef/build, run the following:

  $ make -f ../Makefile.interp

Then activate the resulting Python environment using:

$ source $CHEF_ROOT/python-src/chef/build/python-env/bin/activate

Next, install the Chef native extension:

$ cd $CHEF_ROOT/python-src/chef/pychef && pip install -e .


Phase 2: Preparing the symbolic environment. This phase should run in
"prep" mode in S2E.


Activate the Python environment:

$ source $CHEF_ROOT/python-src/chef/build/python-env/bin/activate

Enable symbolic execution mode:

$ export PYTHONSYMBEX=1

(Optional) The environment includes all the optimization
configurations used in the paper.  To select a particular
optimization, set the "PYTHONSYMBEXOPT" environment variable before
invoking the Python executable:

$ PYTHONSYMBEXOPT=0 python -c 'print "hi"'

The optimization numbers go from 0 (no optimizations) to 4 (all
optimizations) -- see the next section for more details.


Phase 3: Symbolic Execution (the "sym" mode in S2E).


Run the target symbolic test case. For instance:

$ python symtests/asplos_tests.py ArgparseTest



Building a Chef-adapted Python binary
-------------------------------------

Behind the scenes, Makefile.interp builds the Python interpreter under
a set of predefined configurations.  For more flexibility, you can
manually configure & build the interpreter, as follows.

Configure with symbolic execution and optimizations enabled:

$ ./configure [--enable-symbex] [--enable-symbex-opt[=OPT[,OPT[,...]]]] [--prefix=<path>] ...

where OPT can be one of the following:
  none      - No optimization enabled (equivalent to PYTHONSYMBEXOPT=0)
  concrbuff - Memory buffer concretization (equivalent to PYTHONSYMBEXOPT=1)
  intern    - Interning elimination (available when PYTHONSYMBEXOPT=2)
  hashes    - Everything above + Hash neutralization (available when PYTHONSYMBEXOPT=3)
  fastpath  - Everything above + Fast path elimination (available when PYTHONSYMBEXOPT=3)
  all       - All optimizations enabled (available when PYTHONSYMBEXOPT=4 or empty)

Then build as normal (make && make install).

When the "--enable-symbex" flag is set during configuration, the
resulting Python binary receives an additional "-Y" flag which
activates the dynamic instrumentation.  Alternatively, the same can be
achieved by setting the "PYTHONSYMBEX" environment variable.
